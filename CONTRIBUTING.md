# Contributing Guide

We accept contributions from anyone. Here is the general process:

1. Make a fork of the repository.
2. Make your changes, preferably to the `development` branch.
3. Add your contribution to the [`AUTHORS`](/AUTHORS) file. If you're a first-time contributor, add your name and email first (in alphabetical order).
4. Open a PR against the `development` branch.

Changes are squashed and merged into `development`, and then `development` is merged conventionally into `master`.
