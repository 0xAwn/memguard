# Contributing Guide

We accept contributions from anyone. Here is the general process:

1. Make a fork of the repository.
2. Make your changes. If you're a first-time contributor, also add yourself to the [`AUTHORS`](/AUTHORS) file (in alphabetical order).
3. Open a PR against the `development` branch.
